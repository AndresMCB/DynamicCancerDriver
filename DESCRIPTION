Description: We propose a novel approach for causal inference of genes driving one or more core processes
 during cancer development (i.e. dynamic cancer driver ). We use the concept of pseudotime for inferring
 the latent progression of samples along a biological transition during cancer and identifies a critical event
 when such a process is significantly deviated from normal to carcinogenic. We infer driver genes by assessing
 the causal effect they have on the process after such a critical event.
