Description: We propose a novel approach for causal inference of
  genes driving one or more core processes
  during cancer development (i.e. dynamic cancer driver ).
  We use the concept of pseudotime for inferring the latent progression of
  samples along a biological transition during cancer and identifies a critical
  event when such a process is significantly deviated from normal to carcinogenic.
  We infer driver genes by assessing the causal effect they have on the
  process after such a critical event.
