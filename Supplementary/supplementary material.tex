\section{GO biological processes analysis}

We performed a GO biological processes enrichment analysis to the single cell RNA sequencing data from NCBI GEO database, accession GSE75688  \cite{Chung2017} to verify how significantly related are our discoveries to processes in cancer. Our analyses show a significant number of discovered
drivers are strongly related relevant biological processes in cancer disease. Top ten enriched terms (for each trajectory) from Go Biological
Processes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:vimher2gobiologicalprocess2021} . For both dynamic drivers inferred sets (i.e from VIMtime(SC), and HER2time(SC)), top 10 enriched terms (ranked by p-value) are relevant to cancer (e.g.
regulation of transcription and regulation of apoptotic process).

We performed an enrichment analysis to identify gene-disease associations (GDAs) in the inferred drivers from the GSE75688 single cell dataset  \cite{Chung2017}. We use DisGeNET \cite{Pinero2016} as gene-disease associations database for this analysis. Our analyses show a significant number of discovered drivers are strongly related to cancer disease. The top ten enriched GDAs terms (ranked by p-value) for each of the analysed pseudotimes (i.e VIMtime(SC), and HER2time(SC)) are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:disgenetbargraphsc}. In both cases, all of top ten terms are related to cancer disease and cancer progression.
