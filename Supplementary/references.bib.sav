  abstract      = {What is the difference of a prediction that is made with a causal model and a non-causal model? Suppose we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (for example various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},

  abstract = {Studying multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) synergism in gene regulation could help to understand the regulatory mechanisms of complicated human diseases caused by miRNAs. Several existing methods have been presented to infer miRNA synergism. Most of the current methods assume that miRNAs with shared targets at the sequence level are working synergistically. However, it is unclear if miRNAs with shared targets are working in concert to regulate the targets or they individually regulate the targets at different time points or different biological processes. A standard method to test the synergistic activities is to knock-down multiple miRNAs at the same time and measure the changes in the target genes. However, this approach may not be practical as we would have too many sets of miRNAs to test.},

Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a well-established characteristic of CLL, and the robust nature of miRNAs makes them eminently suitable liquid biopsy biomarkers. Using a nested case–control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), the predictive values of five promising human miRNAs (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-223-3p), identified in a pilot study, were examined in serum of 224 CLL cases (diagnosed 3 months to 18 years after enrollment) and 224 matched controls using Taqman based assays. Conditional logistic regressions were applied to adjust for potential confounders. The median time from blood collection to CLL diagnosis was 10 years (p25–p75: 7–13 years). Overall, the upregulation of hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-29a-3p was associated with subsequent risk of CLL [OR1∆Ct-unit increase (95\%CI) = 1.42 (1.18–1.72), 1.64 (1.31–2.04) and 1.75 (1.31–2.34) for hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-29a-3p, respectively] and the strongest associations were observed within 10 years of diagnosis. However, the predictive performance of these miRNAs was modest (area under the curve <0.62). hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-223-3p levels were unrelated to CLL risk. The findings of this first prospective study suggest that hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p were upregulated in early stages of CLL but were modest predictive biomarkers of CLL risk.},

   This is particularly important when miRNAs are considered as candidate
   diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Universal endogenous controls are
   lacking, thus candidate normalizers must be evaluated individually for
   each experiment. Here we present a strategy that we applied to the
   identification of optimal control miRNAs for RT-qPCR profiling of miRNA
   expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and in normal
   cells of T-lineage. First, using NormFinder for an iterative analysis of
   miRNA stability in our miRNA-seq data, we established the number of
   control miRNAs to be used in RT-qPCR. Then, we identified optimal
   control miRNAs by a comprehensive analysis of miRNA stability in
   miRNA-seq data and in RT-qPCR by analysis of RT-qPCR amplification
   efficiency and expression across a variety of T-lineage samples and
   T-ALL cell line culture conditions. We then showed the utility of the
   combination of three miRNAs as endogenous normalizers (hsa-miR-16-5p,
   hsa-miR-25-3p, and hsa-let-7a-5p). These miRNAs might serve as
   first-line candidate endogenous controls for RT-qPCR analysis of miRNAs
   in different types of T-lineage samples: T-ALL patient samples, T-ALL
   cell lines, normal immature thymocytes, and mature T-lymphocytes. The
   strategy we present is universal and can be transferred to other RT-qPCR
   experiments.}},

  abstract                   = {{Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) is a rare, but life-threatening
   condition with a predilection for the periocular region. Eyelid SGC can
   be broadly categorised into two subtypes, namely either nodular or
   pagetoid with the latter being more aggressive and requiring radical
   excision to save life. We have identified key altered microRNAs (miRNA)
   involved in SGC shared by both subtypes, hsa-miR-34a-5p and
   hsa-miR-16-5p. However, their gene targets BCL2 and MYC were
   differentially expressed with both overexpressed in pagetoid but
   unchanged in nodular suggesting different modes of action of these two
   miRNAs on BCL/MYC expression. Hsa-miR-150p is nodular-specifically
   overexpressed, and its target ZEB1 was significantly downregulated in
   nodular SGC suggesting a tumour suppressor role. Invasive pagetoid
   subtype demonstrated specific overexpression of hsa-miR-205 and
   downregulation of hsa-miR-199a. Correspondingly, miRNA gene targets,
   EZH2 (by hsa-miR-205) and CD44 (by hsa-miR-199a), were both
   overexpressed in pagetoid SGC. CD44 has been identified as a potential
   cancer stem cell marker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its
   overexpression in pagetoid cells represents a novel treatment target.
   Aberrant miRNAs and their gene targets have been identified in both SGC
   subtypes, paving the way for better molecular understanding of these
   tumours and identifying new treatment targets.}},

  abstract                   = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is mostly diagnosed at late stages leading to
   high mortality rates due to the scarcity of efficient screening
   approaches exhibiting high diagnostic utility. The current study
   employed a small-RNA deep-sequencing approach for screening microRNA
   (miRNA) differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and evaluating their
   potential as early diagnostic circulating biomarkers for CRC in clinical
   plasma and tissue samples from a Saudi patient population. The cohort
   followed a paired-study design composed of 20 CRC patients, providing
   plasma (P) and tissue (T) samples of CRC, and adjacent normal mucosa
   (CT). Also, control plasma (CP) samples were obtained from neoplasm-free
   healthy individuals to compare its miRNA levels with those in P samples.
   Illumina high-throughput (HiSeq 2000) sequencing was performed for the
   identification of known and novel miRNA genes that were differentially
   expressed in the plasma and tissues of CRC patients compared with CT and
   CP controls. While we identified only one known (hsa-miR-182-5p,
   significantly upregulated) and no novel DEGs at the most stringent
   significance level (P<0.001) in the P-CP comparison, we found 3 and none
   at P<0.01, 7 and 9 at P<0.05 level, respectively. In the T-CT
   comparison, the results revealed 24 known and 196 novel miRNA DEGs
   (P<0.001), 31 and 204 (P<0.01), 41 and 213 (P<0.05), respectively.
   Sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics for potential
   diagnostic miRNAs. Network functional analysis for Gene Ontology (GO)
   and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway implicated
   two pathways rooted to signal transduction {[}Wnt and mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK)] that were enriched in CRC patients. Our results
   suggest that characterizing plasma and tissue profiles of CRC by deep
   sequencing may be a good strategy for identifying known and novel miRNAs
   and that the validated miRNAs described here may serve as potential
   CRC-associated biomarkers. Further research is necessary for determining
   their screen index values and diagnostic utility for the diagnosis of
   CRC.}},

   this way they might influence whether a cell is sensitive or resistant
   to a certain drug. So far, only a limited number of relatively small
   scale studies comprising few cell lines and/or drugs have been
   performed. To obtain a broader view on miRNAs and their association with
   drug response, we investigated the expression levels of 411 miRNAs in
   relation to drug sensitivity in 36 breast cancer cell lines. For this
   purpose IC50 values of a drug screen involving 34 drugs were associated
   with miRNA expression data of the same breast cancer cell lines. Since
   molecular subtype of the breast cancer cell lines is considered a
   confounding factor in drug association studies, multivariate analysis
   taking subtype into account was performed on significant miRNA-drug
   associations which retained 13 associations. These associations
   consisted of 11 different miRNAs and eight different drugs (among which
   Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Veliparib). The taxanes, Paclitaxel and
   Docetaxel, were the only drugs having miRNAs in common: hsa-miR-187-5p
   and hsa-miR-106a-3p indicative of drug resistance while Paclitaxel
   sensitivity alone associated with hsa-miR-556-5p. Tivantinib was
   associated with hsa-let-7d-5p and hsa-miR-18a-5p for sensitivity and
   hsa-miR-637 for resistance. Drug sensitivity was associated with
   hsa-let-7a-5p for Bortezomib, hsa-miR-135a-3p for JNJ-707 and
   hsa-miR-185-3p for Panobinostat. Drug resistance was associated with
   hsa-miR-182-5p for Veliparib and hsa-miR-629-5p for Tipifarnib. Pathway
   analysis for significant miRNAs was performed to reveal biological
   roles, aiding to find a potential mechanistic link for the observed
   associations with drug response. By doing so hsa-miR-187-5p was linked
   to the cell cycle G2-M checkpoint in line with this checkpoint being the
   target of taxanes. In conclusion, our study shows that miRNAs could
   potentially serve as biomarkers for intrinsic drug resistance and that
   pathway analyses can provide additional information in this context.}},

   worldwide. We showed transcriptomic profiles in three pairs of tumors
   and adjacent non-tumor lung tissues using next-generation sequencing
   (NGS) to screen protein-coding RNAs and microRNAs. Combined with
   meta-analysis from the Oncomine and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
   databases, we identified a representative genetic expression signature
   in lung adenocarcinoma. There were 9 upregulated genes, and 8
   downregulated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. The analysis of the effects
   from each gene expression on survival outcome indicated that 6 genes
   (AGR2, SPDEF, CDKN2A, CLDN3, SFN, and PHLDA2) play oncogenic roles, and
   7 genes (PDK4, FMO2, CPED1, GNG11, IL33, BTNL9, and FABP4) act as tumor
   suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we also identified
   putative genetic interactions, in which there were 5 upregulated
   microRNAs with specific targets - hsa-miR-183-5p-BTNL9, hsa-miR-33b5p-
   CPED1, hsa-miR-429-CPED1, hsa-miR-182-5p-FMO2, and hsa-miR-130b-5p-IL33.
   These 5 microRNAs have been shown to be associated with tumorigenesis in
   lung cancer. Our findings suggest that these genetic interactions play
   important roles in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. We propose
   that this molecular change of genetic expression may represent a novel
   signature in lung adenocarcinoma, which may be developed for diagnostic
   and therapeutic strategies in the future.}},

   cancer (NMIBC), matched normal, and cancer tissues of 10 NMIBC were
   examined for RNA sequencing. Methods We profiled the messenger RNA
   (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression of patients with
   NMIBC. Differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were screened between
   cancer and normal tissues and validated by quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction (qPCR), and lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA interaction network was
   constructed. Results A total of 91 upregulated and 190 downregulated
   genes and 34 upregulated and 58 downregulated lncRNAs were screened from
   the sequencing result. The differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched
   in focal adhesion, rap1 signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway,
   PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor
   interaction, Ras signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein
   kinases signaling pathway, of which some pathways were involved in the
   cancer development. In the RNA sequencing, KIT and laminin subunit gamma
   gamma 3 (LAMC3) were significantly downregulated in the NMIBC group
   compared with the normal group. The results of quantitative reverse
   transcription PCR showed that the expression of LAMC3 and KIT were
   significantly decreased in the NMIBC group compared with the normal
   group. The lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA interaction network was constructed by
   Cytoscape software to further investigate the interaction correlations.
   The results implied that KIT and LAMC3 might regulate the lncRNAs (such

   intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), we used bioinformatics analysis
   methods to construct an ICC-related ceRNA regulatory network (ceRNET),
   which contained 340 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships based on
   the RNA expression datasets in the NCBI GEO database. We identified the
   core regulatory pathway RP11-328K4.1-hsa-miR-27a-3p-PROS1, which is
   related to ICC, for further validation by molecular biology assays. GO
   analysis of 44 differentially expressed mRNAs in ceRNET revealed that
   they were mainly enriched in biological processes including ``negative
   regulation of epithelial cell proliferation{''} and ``positive
   regulation of activated T lymphocyte proliferation.{''} KEGG analysis
   showed that they were mainly enriched in the ``complement and
   coagulation cascade{''} pathway. The molecular biology assay showed that
   lncRNA RP11-328K4.1 expression was significantly lower in the cancerous
   tissues and peripheral plasma of ICC patients than in normal controls
   (p<0.05). In addition, hsa-miR27a-3p was found to be significantly
   upregulated in the cancer tissues and peripheral plasma of ICC patients
   (p<0.05). Compared to normal controls, the expression of PROS1 mRNA was
   significantly downregulated in ICC patient cancer tissues (p<0.05) but
   not in peripheral plasma (p>0.05). Furthermore, ROC analysis revealed
   that RP11-328K4.1, hsa-miR-27a-3p, and PROS1 had significant diagnostic
   value in ICC. We concluded that the upregulation of lncRNA RP11-328K4.1,
   which might act as a miRNA sponge, exerts an antitumor effect in ICC by
   eliminating the inhibition of PROS1 mRNA expression by oncogenic miRNA
   hsa-miR-27a.}},

  abstract                   = {{Background: The role of small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in several
   types of cancer has been evident. However, its expression studies have
   never been performed in gastric cancer (GC) patients from Saudi
   population. First time this study was conducted to identify miRNAs that
   are differentially expressed in GC patients compared with normal
   controls.
   Methods: We investigated the role of miRNAs in GC patients using
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 34 samples from GC
   patients (early stage = 7 and late-stage = 26) and 15 from normal
   control. We have used miRNA microarray analysis and validated the
   results by Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
   Results: We obtained data of 1082 expressed genes, from cancer tissues
   and noncancerous tissues (49 samples in total). Where 129 genes were
   up-regulated (P > 0.05) and 953 genes (P > 0.05) were down-regulated in
   49 FFPE tissue samples. Only 33 miRNAs had significant expression in
   early and late-stage cancer tissues. After candidate miRNAs were
   selected, RT-qPCR further confirmed that four miRNAs (hsa-miR-200c-3p,
   hsa-miR-3613, hsa-miR-27b-3p, hsa-miR-4668-5p) were significantly
   aberrant in GC tissues compared to the normal gastric tissues.
   Conclusions: In this study we provide miRNAs profile of GC where many
   miRNAs showed aberrant expression from normal tissues, suggesting their
   involvement in the development and progression of gastric cancer. In
   early and late-stage miR-200c-3p showed significant down regulation as
   compare to control samples. Many of miRNAs reported in our study showing
   up-regulation are new and not reported before may be due to population
   difference. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-200c-3p had
   potential to use as diagnostic biomarker for distinguishing GC patients
   from normal individuals and can be used for diagnosis of cancer at early
   stage.}},

  abstract        = {Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions such as cancers. However, it remains a challenging problem to discover the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of a miRNA in a data driven fashion. On one hand, sequence-based methods for predicting miRNA targets tend to make too many false positive calls. On the other hand, analyzing expression correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs cannot establish whether relationship between a pair of correlated miRNA and mRNA is causal. In this study, we designed a deep learning model, referred to as miRNA causal deep net (mCADET), which aims to explicitly represent two types of statistical relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs: correlation resulting from confounded co-regulation and correlation as a result of causal regulation. The model utilizes a deep neural network to simulate transcription mechanism that leads to co-expression of miRNA and mRNA, and, in addition, it also contains directed edges from miRNAs to mRNAs to capture causal relationships among them. We trained the mCADET model using pan-cancer miRNA and mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to investigate mechanism of co-expression and causal interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative analyses of the results indicate that the mCADET significantly outperforms conventional deep learning models when modeling combined miRNA and mRNA expression data, indicating its superior capability of capturing the high-order statistical structures in the data. Qualitative analysis of predicted targets of miRNAs indicate that predictions by mCADET agree well with existing knowledge. Finally, the predictions by mCADET have a significantly lower false discovery rate and better overall accuracy in comparison to sequence-based and correlation-based methods when comparing to experimental results. The mCADET model can simultaneously infer the states of cellular signaling system regulating co-expression of miRNAs and mRNAs, while capturing their causal relationships in a data-driven fashion.},

   progression and metastasis. Identifying key miRNAs, defined by their
   functional activities, can provide a deeper understanding of biology of
   miRNAs in cancer. However, miRNA expression level cannot accurately
   reflect miRNA activity.
   Results: We developed a computational approach, ActMiR, for identifying
   active miRNAs and miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms. Applying ActMiR
   to four cancer datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we showed
   that (i) miRNA activity was tumor subtype specific; (ii) genes
   correlated with inferred miRNA activities were more likely to enrich for
   miRNA binding motifs; (iii) expression levels of these genes and
   inferred miRNA activities were more likely to be negatively correlated.
   For the four cancer types in TCGA we identified 77-229 key miRNAs for
   each cancer subtype and annotated their biological functions. The
   miRNA-target pairs, predicted by our ActMiR algorithm but not by
   correlation of miRNA expression levels, were experimentally validated.
   The functional activities of key miRNAs were further demonstrated to be
   associated with clinical outcomes for other cancer types using
   independent datasets. For ER-/HER2(-) breast cancers, we identified
   activities of key miRNAs let-7d and miR-18a as potential prognostic
   markers and validated them in two independent ER-/HER2(-) breast cancer
   datasets. Our work provides a novel scheme to facilitate our
   understanding of miRNA. In summary, inferred activity of key miRNA
   provided a functional link to its mediated regulatory network, and can
   be used to robustly predict patient's survival.}},

   a big challenge to identify which miRNAs are related to which cancer
   considering the complex processes involved in tumors, where one miRNA
   may target hundreds or even thousands of genes and one gene may regulate
   multiple miRNAs. Despite integrative analysis of matched gene and miRNA
   expression data can help identify cancer-associated miRNAs, such kind of
   data is not commonly available. On the other hand, there are huge amount
   of gene expression data that are publicly accessible. It will
   significantly improve the efficiency of characterizing miRNA's function
   in cancer if we can identify cancer miRNAs directly from gene expression
   data.
   Results: We present a novel computational framework to identify the
   cancer-related miRNAs based solely on gene expression profiles without
   requiring either miRNA expression data or the matched gene and miRNA
   expression data. The results on multiple cancer datasets show that our
   proposed method can effectively identify cancer-related miRNAs with
   higher precision compared with other popular approaches. Furthermore,
   some of our novel predictions are validated by both differentially

  abstract                   = {{Motivation: Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) act as regulators of global
   protein output. While their major effect is on protein levels of target
   genes, it has been proven that they also specifically impact on the
   messenger RNA level of targets. Prominent interest in miRNAs strongly
   motivates the need for increasing the options available to detect their
   cellular activity.
   Results: We used the effect of miRNAs over their targets for the
   detection of miRNA activity using mRNAs expression profiles. Here we
   describe the method, called T-REX (from Targets' Reverse EXpression),
   compare it to other similar applications, show its effectiveness and
   apply it to build activity maps. We used six different target
   predictions from each of four algorithms: TargetScan, PicTar,
   DIANA-microT and DIANA Union. First, we proved the sensitivity and
   specificity of our technique in miRNA over-expression and knock-out
   animal models. Then, we used whole transcriptome data from acute myeloid
   leukemia to show that we could identify critical miRNAs in a real life,
   complex, clinically relevant dataset. Finally, we studied 66 different
   cellular conditions to confirm and extend the current knowledge on the
   role of miRNAs in cellular physiology and in cancer.}},

The characterization of miRNA–gene interactions will lead to a better understanding of cancer mechanisms. Many computational methods have been developed to infer miRNA targets with/without expression data. Because expression datasets are in general limited in size, most existing methods concatenate datasets from multiple studies to form one aggregated dataset to increase sample size and power. However, such simple aggregation analysis results in identifying miRNA–gene interactions that are mostly common across datasets, whereas specific interactions may be missed by these methods. Recent releases of The Cancer Genome Atlas data provide paired expression profiling of miRNAs and genes in multiple tumors with sufficiently large sample size. To study both common and cancer-specific interactions, it is desirable to develop a method that can jointly analyze multiple cancers to study miRNA–gene interactions without combining all the data into one single dataset.Results: We developed a novel statistical method to jointly analyze expression profiles from multiple cancers to identify miRNA–gene interactions that are both common across cancers and specific to certain cancers. The benefit of this joint analysis approach is demonstrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Compared with simple aggregate analysis or single sample analysis, our method can effectively use the shared information among different but related cancers to improve the identification of miRNA–gene interactions. Another useful property of our method is that it can estimate similarity among cancers through their shared miRNA–gene interactions.Availability and implementation: The program, MCMG, implemented in R is available at http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/group/.Contact:hongyu.zhao@yale.edu}},

Clinical microarray results demonstrated that increased levels of vimentin mRNA after chemotherapy correlated to a poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. We hypothesized that vimentin mediated the reorganization of cytoskeletons to maintain the mechanical integrity in EMT cancer cells. By using knockdown strategy, the results showed reduced cell proliferation, impaired wound healing, loss of directional migration, and increased large membrane extension in MDA-MB 231 cells. Vimentin depletion also induced reorganization of cytoskeletons and reduced focal adhesions, which resulted in impaired mechanical strength because of reduced cell stiffness and contractile force. In addition, overexpressing vimentin in MCF7 cells increased cell stiffness, elevated cell motility and directional migration, reoriented microtubule polarity, and increased EMT phenotypes due to the increased β1-integrin and the loss of junction protein E-cadherin. The EMT-related transcription factor slug was also mediated by vimentin. The current study demonstrated that vimentin serves as a regulator to maintain intracellular mechanical homeostasis by mediating cytoskeleton architecture and the balance of cell force generation in EMT cancer cells.},

  abstract      = {Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, functioning in part by facilitating the degradation of target mRNAs. They have an established role in controlling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a reversible phenotypic program underlying normal and pathological processes. Many studies demonstrate the role of individual miRNAs using overexpression at levels greatly exceeding physiological abundance. This can influence transcripts with relatively poor targeting and may in part explain why over 130 different miRNAs are directly implicated as EMT regulators. Analyzing a human mammary cell model of EMT we found evidence that a set of miRNAs, including the miR-200 and miR-182/183 family members, co-operate in post-transcriptional regulation, both reinforcing and buffering transcriptional output. Investigating this, we demonstrate that combinatorial treatment altered cellular phenotype with miRNA concentrations much closer to endogenous levels and with less off-target effects. This suggests that co-operative targeting by miRNAs is important for their physiological function and future work classifying miRNAs should consider such combinatorial effects.},
