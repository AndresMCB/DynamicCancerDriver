  abstract = {Although a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of tumours of a given type (>20%), most are mutated at intermediate frequencies (2-20%). To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

We characterized SCNA patterns in 4,934 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer data set. Whole-genome doubling, observed in 37% of cancers, was associated with higher rates of every other type of SCNA, TP53 mutations, CCNE1 amplifications and alterations of the PPP2R complex. SCNAs that were internal to chromosomes tended to be shorter than telomere-bounded SCNAs, suggesting different mechanisms underlying their generation. Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions. These results provide insights into mechanisms of generation and functional consequences of cancer-related SCNAs.},

Major progress has been made in bioinformatics and experimental study for the TF and miRNA co-regulation in recent years.

Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we describe DriverPower, a software package that uses mutational burden and functional impact evidence to identify driver mutations in coding and non-coding sites within cancer whole genomes. Using a total of 1373 genomic features derived from public sources, DriverPower's background mutation model explains up to 93% of the regional variance in the mutation rate across multiple tumour types. By incorporating functional impact scores, we are able to further increase the accuracy of driver discovery. Testing across a collection of 2583 cancer genomes from the PCAWG project, DriverPower identifies 217 coding and 95 non-coding driver candidates. Comparing to six published methods used by the PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Working Group, DriverPower has the highest F1 score for both coding and non-coding driver discovery. This demonstrates that DriverPower is an effective framework for computational driver discovery.},

  abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity is a common characteristic across diverse cancer types and presents challenges to current standards of treatment. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging technologies provide opportunities to identify and characterize these aspects of heterogeneity. Notably, transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell resolution enables quantitative measurements of the molecular activity that underlies the phenotypic diversity of cells within a tumor. Such high-dimensional data require computational analysis to extract relevant biological insights about the cell types and states that drive cancer development, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight emerging themes in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data and their applications to cancer research. We focus on downstream analytical challenges relevant to cancer research, including how to computationally perform unified analysis across many patients and disease states, distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic cells, infer communication with the tumor microenvironment, and delineate tumoral and microenvironmental evolution with trajectory and RNA velocity analysis. We include discussions of challenges and opportunities for future computational methodological advancements necessary to realize the translational potential of single-cell transcriptomic profiling in cancer.},

Current approaches either identify driver genes on the basis of mutational recurrence or approximate the functional consequences of nonsynonymous mutations by using bioinformatic scores. Passenger mutations are enriched in characteristic nucleotide contexts, whereas driver mutations occur in functional positions, which are not necessarily surrounded by a particular nucleotide context. We observed that mutations in contexts that deviate from the characteristic contexts around passenger mutations provide a signal in favor of driver genes. We therefore developed a method that combines this feature with the signals traditionally used for driver-gene identification. We applied our method to whole-exome sequencing data from 11,873 tumor-normal pairs and identified 460 driver genes that clustered into 21 cancer-related pathways. Our study provides a resource of driver genes across 28 tumor types with additional driver genes identified according to mutations in unusual nucleotide contexts.},

Distinguishing those mutated genes that drive tumorigenesis in a patient is a primary goal in cancer therapy: Knowledge of these genes and the pathways on which they operate can illuminate disease mechanisms and indicate potential therapies and drug targets. Current research focuses mainly on cohort-level driver gene identification but patient-specific driver gene identification remains a challenge. We developed a new algorithm for patient-specific ranking of driver genes. The algorithm, called PRODIGY, analyzes the expression and mutation profiles of the patient along with data on known pathways and protein-protein interactions. Prodigy quantifies the impact of each mutated gene on every deregulated pathway using the prize-collecting Steiner tree model. Mutated genes are ranked by their aggregated impact on all deregulated pathways. In testing on five TCGA cancer cohorts spanning >2500 patients and comparison to validated driver genes, Prodigy outperformed extant methods and ranking based on network centrality measures. Our results pinpoint the pleiotropic effect of driver genes and show that Prodigy is capable of identifying even very rare drivers. Hence, Prodigy takes a step further toward personalized medicine and treatment. The Prodigy R package is available at: https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/PRODIGY.

  abstract               = {Population dynamics of regulatory T cells (Treg) are crucial for the underlying interplay between leukemic and immune cells in progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The goal of this work is to elucidate the dynamics of a model that includes Treg, which can be qualitatively assessed by accumulating clinical findings on the impact of activated immune cell infusion after selective Treg depletion. We constructed an ordinary differential equation model to describe the dynamics of three components in AML: leukemic blast cells, mature regulatory T cells (Treg), and mature effective T cells (Teff), including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The model includes promotion of Treg expansion by leukemic blast cells, leukemic stem cell and progenitor cell targeting by Teff, and Treg-mediated Teff suppression, and exhibits two coexisting, stable steady states, corresponding to high leukemic cell load at diagnosis or relapse, and to long-term complete remission. Our model is capable of explaining the clinical findings that the survival of patients with AML after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is influenced by the duration of complete remission, and that cut-off minimal residual disease thresholds associated with a 100% relapse rate are identified in AML.},

As a result, much has been learned about the development of cancer, but with so many distinct cancer and tissue types, there is much more to be learned. Now with the development of massively parallel DNA sequencing, hundreds of millions of cancer-related mutations will soon be revealed. In a broad-ranging review, Michael Stratton, Peter Campbell and Andrew Futreal look back at the achievements of cancer genomics, and forward to the prospect that the complete DNA sequencing of large numbers of cancers will help us move towards a deeper understanding of how to treat cancers.},

  abstract  = {Identification of mutations of the genes that give cancer a selective advantage is an important step towards research and clinical objectives. As such, there has been a growing interest in developing methods for identification of driver genes and their temporal order within a single patient (intra-tumor) as well as across a cohort of patients (inter-tumor). In this paper, we develop a probabilistic model for tumor progression, in which the driver genes are clustered into several ordered driver pathways. We develop an efficient inference algorithm that exhibits favorable scalability to the number of genes and samples compared to a previously introduced ILP-based method. Adopting a probabilistic approach also allows principled approaches to model selection and uncertainty quantification. Using a large set of experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our superior performance compared to the ILP-based method. We also analyze two biological datasets of colorectal and glioblastoma cancers. We emphasize that while the ILP-based method puts many seemingly passenger genes in the driver pathways, our algorithm keeps focused on truly driver genes and outputs more accurate models for cancer progression.},

  abstract = {Cancer driver gene alterations influence cancer development, occurring in oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and dual role genes. Discovering dual role cancer genes is difficult because of their elusive context-dependent behavior. We define oncogenic mediators as genes controlling biological processes. With them, we classify cancer driver genes, unveiling their roles in cancer mechanisms. To this end, we present Moonlight, a tool that incorporates multiple -omics data to identify critical cancer driver genes. With Moonlight, we analyze 8000+ tumor samples from 18 cancer types, discovering 3310 oncogenic mediators, 151 having dual roles. By incorporating additional data (amplification, mutation, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility), we reveal 1000+ cancer driver genes, corroborating known molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we confirm critical cancer driver genes by analysing cell-line datasets. We discover inactivation of tumor suppressors in intron regions and that tissue type and subtype indicate dual role status. These findings help explain tumor heterogeneity and could guide therapeutic decisions.},

Here we adopt this powerful approach to breast cancer and analyse 515 cells from 11 patients. Inferred copy number variations from the single-cell RNA-seq data separate carcinoma cells from non-cancer cells. At a single-cell resolution, carcinoma cells display common signatures within the tumour as well as intratumoral heterogeneity regarding breast cancer subtype and crucial cancer-related pathways. Most of the non-cancer cells are immune cells, with three distinct clusters of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. T lymphocytes and macrophages both display immunosuppressive characteristics: T cells with a regulatory or an exhausted phenotype and macrophages with an M2 phenotype. These results illustrate that the breast cancer transcriptome has a wide range of intratumoral heterogeneity, which is shaped by the tumour cells and immune cells in the surrounding microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10-18.},

However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype–phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.}},

AXL can be activated by its ligand GAS6 or by other kinases, but the signaling pathways conferring its metastatic activity are unknown. Here, we define the AXL-regulated phosphoproteome in breast cancer cells. We reveal that AXL stimulates the phosphorylation of a network of focal adhesion (FA) proteins, culminating in faster FA disassembly. Mechanistically, AXL phosphorylates NEDD9, leading to its binding to CRKII which in turn associates with and orchestrates the phosphorylation of the pseudo-kinase PEAK1. We find that PEAK1 is in complex with the tyrosine kinase CSK to mediate the phosphorylation of PAXILLIN. Uncoupling of PEAK1 from AXL signaling decreases metastasis in vivo, but not tumor growth. Our results uncover a contribution of AXL signaling to FA dynamics, reveal a long sought-after mechanism underlying AXL metastatic activity, and identify PEAK1 as a therapeutic target in AXL positive tumors.},

To better understand the limited responses to this combination we analysed the genetic, microenvironmental, and immune factors in tumours derived from a transgenic breast cancer model. We identified two tumours with similar growth characteristics but different RT responses primarily due to an antitumour immune response. The combination of RT and checkpoint immunotherapy resulted in cures in the responsive but not the unresponsive tumours. Profiling the tumours revealed that the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in the unresponsive tumours, and Axl knockout resulted in slower growth and increased radiosensitivity. These changes were associated with a CD8+ T-cell response, which was improved in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy. These results suggest a novel role for Axl in suppressing antigen presentation through MHCI, and enhancing cytokine release, which promotes a suppressive myeloid microenvironment.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling regulates breast cancer initiation and progression and associated cancer phenotypes. We previously identified E-cadherin (CDH1) as a repressor of IGF1 signaling and in this study examined how loss of E-cadherin affects IGF1R signaling and response to anti-IGF1R/insulin receptor (InsR) therapies in breast cancer.Experimental Design: Breast cancer cell lines were used to assess how altered E-cadherin levels regulate IGF1R signaling and response to two anti-IGF1R/InsR therapies. In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to define interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin. TCGA RNA-seq and RPPA data were used to compare IGF1R/InsR activation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors. ER+ ILC cell lines and xenograft tumor explant cultures were used to evaluate efficacy to IGF1R pathway inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy.Results: Diminished functional E-cadherin increased both activation of IGF1R signaling and efficacy to anti-IGF1R/InsR therapies. PLA demonstrated a direct endogenous interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin at points of cell{\textendash}cell contact. Increased expression of IGF1 ligand and levels of IGF1R/InsR phosphorylation were observed in E-cadherin{\textendash}deficient ER+ ILC compared with IDC tumors. IGF1R pathway inhibitors were effective in inhibiting growth in ER+ ILC cell lines and synergized with endocrine therapy and similarly IGF1R/InsR inhibition reduced proliferation in ILC tumor explant culture.Conclusions: We provide evidence that loss of E-cadherin hyperactivates the IGF1R pathway and increases sensitivity to IGF1R/InsR targeted therapy, thus identifying the IGF1R pathway as a potential novel target in E-cadherin{\textendash}deficient breast cancers.

It involves a profound transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming of cells. A critical role of epigenetic modifiers and their specific chromatin modifications has been demonstrated during EMT. However, it has remained elusive whether epigenetic control differs between the dynamic cell state transitions of reversible EMT and the fixed differentiation status of irreversible EMT. We have employed varying EMT models of murine breast cancer cells to identify the key players establishing epithelial-mesenchymal cell plasticity during reversible and irreversible EMT. We demonstrate that the Mbd3/NuRD complex and the activities of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and Tet2 hydroxylase play a critical role in keeping cancer cells in a highly metastatic mesenchymal state. Combinatorial interference with their functions leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and efficiently represses metastasis formation by invasive murine and human breast cancer cells in vivo.},

  abstract = {Summary
Despite the importance of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in inhibiting T cell effector activity, the mechanisms regulating its expression remain poorly defined. We found that the chromatin organizer special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) restrains PD-1 expression induced upon T cell activation by recruiting a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex to Pdcd1 regulatory regions. Satb1 deficienct T cells exhibited a 40-fold increase in PD-1 expression. Tumor-derived transforming growth factor β (Tgf-β) decreased Satb1 expression through binding of Smad proteins to the Satb1 promoter. Smad proteins also competed with the Satb1-NuRD complex for binding to Pdcd1 enhancers, releasing Pdcd1 expression from Satb1-mediated repression, Satb1-deficient tumor-reactive T cells lost effector activity more rapidly than wild-type lymphocytes at tumor beds expressing PD-1 ligand (CD274), and these differences were abrogated by sustained CD274 blockade. Our findings suggest that Satb1 functions to prevent premature T cell exhaustion by regulating Pdcd1 expression upon T cell activation. Dysregulation of this pathway in tumor-infiltrating T cells results in diminished anti-tumor immunity.},

  abstract = {<b><i>Background/Aims:</i></b> The metabolic features of cancer cells have long been acknowledged to be altered and to provide new therapeutic opportunities. The expression of glycolytic enzyme enolase 2 (ENO2) was found to be closely associated with the clinical features of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, but its functions remain unclear in ALL. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We evaluated the association between ENO2 mRNA expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and the efficacy of chemotherapy, and further explored the function of ENO2 in ALL. The molecular mechanisms of ENO2 expression and its effects on cell growth, glycolysis and glucocorticoid resistance were explored by Cell Counting Kit-8, glucose-consumption assay, Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenesis in NOD/SCID mice. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The results showed that ENO2 mRNA expression in BM-MNCs was significantly decreased when patients completed induction chemotherapy and reached complete remission (CR). ENO2 mRNA expression was increased when patients suffered relapse. Functional studies demonstrated that ENO2 promoted cell growth, glycolysis, and glucocorticoid resistance, all of which were effectively inhibited when ENO2 was silenced with shRNAs. Further studies revealed that ENO2 up-regulated various glycolysis-related genes and enhanced Akt activity with subsequent glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation, inducing cell proliferation and glycolysis. The combination of silencing ENO2 and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) synergistically inhibited leukemia cell survival. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> These results indicate that ENO2 may be a biological marker for monitoring chemotherapeutic efficacy and relapse in ALL. ENO2 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for ALL.},
