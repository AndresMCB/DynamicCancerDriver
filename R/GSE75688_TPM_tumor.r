#'@title Gene expression data (TPM) from GSE75688 (only SC tumor samples)
#'@description A \code{matrix} containing the single cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
#'from GSE75688_TPM after filtering and pre-processing. A pre process was
#'performed to samples from tumor cells. A filtering process was perfomed to discard
#'the gene expression of genes not expressed in at east 20% of the samples.\cr
#'This dataset is used for the experiment described in our paper.
